# Business OS 2027 — Dependency-Ordered Implementation Map

## AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS Production closeout — 2026-09-30

- Work Package: `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the internally controlled notification projection, preference, escalation and configured-delivery RC scope.
- Implementation PR #360 merged to canonical `main@02d7fe39897ee7cd96d6e75c45b6f2355ed99051`; final implementation head was `d02415f5e3fd55e3aed6c7c25ab7493deaf721c2`.
- Exact-head CI `36641388201` succeeded across lint, typecheck, tests, the complete PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke regression chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification. Exact-main CI `36642548223` succeeded on the implementation merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36642802504` succeeded on that exact SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0155_automation_notifications` is live as version `20260929230224`; merged migration blob SHA is `2eb66ee4941aadd1dc9f0fd489abd0d781f0d194`.
- Canonical business/event truth remains in existing `audit_logs`, approval evidence and Automation runtime state. `notification_inbox` is a per-member projection, `notification_delivery_receipts` is terminal delivery evidence, and `notification_projection_checkpoints` is a projection watermark. No second event bus, workflow runtime, provider-send authority or notification work queue was introduced.
- Projection is cutover-safe and lossless: existing Organizations start at the migration cutover, historical events are not replayed, and the cursor is ordered by `(created_at,id)`. Current supported source evidence is governed approval escalation/expiry plus Automation runtime dead-letter evidence.
- In-app notification read/acknowledge and per-member preferences are governed. High/critical alerts have bounded escalation; acknowledgement stops further escalation. Default role targeting keeps Automation DLQ alerts to OWNER/ADMIN and approval alerts to eligible management/reviewer recipients.
- Telegram owner delivery reuses the existing Telegram notification authority and dedupe evidence. Email delivery reuses the existing Resend/email-provider authority plus cost guard. Configuration blockers remain retryable rather than being recorded as false terminal delivery receipts.
- Production currently has no configured notification email or notification mailbox, so real email notification delivery is **BLOCKED_EXTERNAL / configuration-pending** rather than claimed as live-verified. Push remains **DEPENDENCY_PENDING** on canonical device-registration/push-provider authority. SMS remains **DEPENDENCY_PENDING** on a Production-verified `OMNI-SMS-RCS` provider route.
- Production activation was intentionally side-effect clean: notification preferences 0, notification inbox 0, delivery receipts 0, Automation Rules 0, Automation Runs 0, Runtime Actions 0, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108, Follow-up Jobs 6, pending approvals 9 and decided approvals 0. No synthetic Production notification, runtime event or provider send was created to demonstrate the feature.
- Notification tables have RLS enabled. Trusted mutation/projection/delivery RPCs are SECURITY INVOKER, service-role executable only, and denied to authenticated/anon callers. Authenticated users receive self-scoped read access only.
- Post-`0155` advisor verification exposed exactly two new unindexed notification foreign keys. Hotfix PR #361 added covering indexes only and merged to `main@e0ce35b157ad716286b0585231f90c5874bdc380`; hotfix head was `0ddc997f72c51e403823a20411e59f0b4c3f6af0`.
- Hotfix exact-head CI `36643473325` and exact-main CI `36643793575` succeeded. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36644062870` succeeded on the exact hotfix merge SHA. Production migration `0156_automation_notifications_fk_index_hardening` is live as version `20260929231538`; merged migration blob SHA is `702a84ea9f3c365f2f3c351e949118ed304fe63e`.
- Both notification FK covering indexes are valid and ready in Production. Performance advisor `unindexed_foreign_keys` returned from 16 to the pre-Notifications baseline 14 with zero notification-specific FK findings. Security advisor remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15 plus leaked-password-protection WARN 1; performance baseline remains auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6.
- Production safety remains fail-safe: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION BOOKING_OPERATIONS -> BOOKING-CATALOG`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs plus existing service/product catalog, branch/location, staff/team eligibility, business hours/resources, CRM/custom-object authorities and every booking-related schema/code path. Extend canonical authorities only; do not create a second service catalog, staff directory, branch model, resource truth, availability engine or booking lifecycle authority.

---

## AUTO-BUILDER Production closeout — 2026-09-30

- Work Package: `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-BUILDER`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the internally controlled business-facing Automation Builder RC scope.
- Implementation PR #358 merged to canonical `main@96d6ecefda8d23fd8126dddd7f50e6709ff677fc`; final implementation head was `f265026ef314952fe64934e2e0686e8e325c0724`.
- Exact-head CI `36637555138` succeeded across lint, typecheck, **1418 tests**, the complete PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke regression chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification.
- Exact-main CI `36637897801` succeeded on the Builder merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36638174944` succeeded on that exact SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- AUTO-BUILDER required **no database migration**. Canonical workflow-definition authority remains `public.automation_rules` plus immutable `public.automation_rule_versions`; runtime truth remains `public.automation_runs` + `public.automation_run_actions`. No second workflow model, trigger catalog, condition store, action registry, executor, queue, scheduler or approval engine was introduced.
- The `/automations` surface is now a business-facing visual **When -> Only if -> Then** builder over the existing Trigger Catalog, typed Condition Fact Catalog and Tool/Action Registry. Raw Conditions/Actions JSON editing is no longer the normal builder path.
- Governed starter templates use only currently AVAILABLE trigger/action contracts. Action selection is scope-aware and action-specific business configuration is exposed for Preview, Human Handoff, Operator Brief, MARK_HOT, SEND_FOLLOWUP and PAUSE_AUTOMATION.
- Existing advanced/nested condition graphs are preserved exactly rather than silently flattened. Replacing an advanced graph with simpler visual conditions requires an explicit user action.
- Test Mode is side-effect-free: it reuses canonical trigger/condition/action/runtime validators and can optionally evaluate conditions read-only against one Organization-scoped subject. It does **not** enqueue an Automation event, create a run, execute an action, send a provider message or bypass approval/Shadow policy.
- Draft save, Publish and Enable/Disable remain separate explicit governed operations through the existing workflow RPC boundary. Creating a workflow produces a disabled draft; saving never implicitly publishes or enables it.
- Version comparison reads immutable `automation_rule_versions`; execution history and error diagnostics read canonical runtime tables, including action attempts, terminal errors and compensation state. Builder history does not create a parallel reporting/runtime store.
- Production remained unseeded and side-effect clean after deployment: Automation Rules 0, published versions 0, Automation Runs 0, Runtime Actions 0, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108, Follow-up Jobs 6, pending approvals 9 and decided approvals 0. No synthetic Production workflow or runtime event was created merely to demonstrate the Builder.
- Production Builder contracts remain 17 AVAILABLE triggers, 61 typed condition facts and all 6 canonical Tool/Action contracts AVAILABLE.
- No migration was added after `0154_automation_runtime_fk_index_hardening`; Production migration history remains unchanged by AUTO-BUILDER.
- Production safety remains fail-safe: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.
- Post-deploy advisor baseline is unchanged: security RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15 plus leaked-password-protection WARN 1; performance unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6.
- **Not claimed here:** automation notification delivery/escalation surfaces. Those remain the separate `AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS` Work Package.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs plus existing notification/event authorities, approval escalation evidence, runtime DLQ/compensation/error states, operator surfaces and channel delivery boundaries. Extend canonical notification/event paths only; do not create a second event bus, notification queue, provider-send authority, alert truth or workflow runtime.

---

## AUTO-RUNTIME Production closeout — 2026-09-30

- Work Package: `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-RUNTIME`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the internally controlled durable workflow-execution RC scope.
- Implementation PR #355 merged to canonical `main@9d540a4c75bab5aaeef771fa260f8093880077fc`; final implementation head was `caa793cdb137c21f9df2bc777ea4f0f3d56808ea`.
- Exact-head CI `36630486924` succeeded across lint, typecheck, tests, the complete PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification. Controlled SQL acceptance covered event idempotency, immutable published-version execution, ordered actions, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` leasing, verified-success gating, bounded retry, timeout recovery, DLQ, compensation requirements, Global Kill Switch, Agents Pause, approval/Shadow waits and scheduled approval deadline reconciliation.
- Exact-main CI `36631038101` succeeded on the runtime merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36631362277` succeeded on that exact SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0153_automation_runtime` is live as version `20260929211117`; merged migration blob SHA is `41a500b9d0490794dde5f4146cff00aa13ad258d`.
- Canonical workflow-definition authority remains `public.automation_rules` plus immutable `public.automation_rule_versions`. `public.automation_runs` and `public.automation_run_actions` are child runtime state only. The action table is the ordered durable runtime outbox/DLQ state, not a second workflow engine, generic queue, action gateway or provider-send authority.
- The existing Cloudflare Worker `scheduled()` loop remains the scheduler. No `pg_cron`, `pgmq` or parallel scheduler was introduced. Existing `agent_runs` and `followup_jobs` retain their domain-specific authority; the 6 real legacy overdue `followup_jobs` were not executed or mutated.
- Runtime executes only immutable published READY versions. Event ingestion is idempotent by Organization/rule/version/source-event key. Action claims use bounded leases and `SKIP LOCKED`; actions execute in order. Internal idempotent actions use bounded retry, while external-provider ambiguity never blind-retries after provider acceptance and moves to reconciliation-only evidence.
- Success requires verifier evidence. Terminal failures are durable DLQ state and prior successful side effects can be marked compensation-required for governed resolution.
- Global Kill Switch and Agents Pause both fail closed at the claim boundary and controlled PostgreSQL acceptance proves claims resume only after release. Disabling a workflow cancels unstarted runtime actions.
- Approval deadlines are now scheduled by AUTO-RUNTIME through the existing `reconcile_due_message_approvals` authority. `WAITING_APPROVAL`, `WAITING_RELEASE` and `VERIFYING` are durable external waits rather than active short-deadline execution; after release, active runtime deadline budget is restored.
- All 6 canonical Tool/Action contracts are now `AVAILABLE`: `GENERATE_PREVIEW`, `HANDOFF_HUMAN`, `CREATE_OPERATOR_BRIEF`, `MARK_HOT`, `PAUSE_AUTOMATION` and `SEND_FOLLOWUP`. Runtime reuses their existing authorities instead of bypassing them.
- `SEND_FOLLOWUP` creates the canonical approval artifact, waits for governed approval, remains `WAITING_RELEASE` while Shadow Mode is ON, and only after release routes through the existing approved-send authority. No direct provider client was added to the runtime dispatcher and no controlled Shadow bypass was introduced.
- Runtime mutation/claim/reconciliation/command RPCs are SECURITY INVOKER and service-role executable only; authenticated and anon execution is denied. Runtime tables have RLS enabled and authenticated Organization-member read policies.
- Production verification after `0153` remained side-effect clean: Automation Rules 0, published Automation versions 0, Automation Runs 0, Runtime Actions 0, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108, Follow-up Jobs 6, pending approvals 9 and decided approvals 0. No synthetic Production workflow/event/run or provider call was created.
- Post-`0153` advisor verification exposed exactly 7 new unindexed runtime foreign keys. Hotfix PR #356 added covering indexes only and merged to `main@3655644a709ba206fbd75e5b58497a8d696326c4`; hotfix head was `1f3a6337cf60757d80fb538a929eff3a3e3e5723`.
- Hotfix exact-head CI `36631862464` and exact-main CI `36632242868` succeeded. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36632563479` succeeded on the hotfix merge SHA. Production migration `0154_automation_runtime_fk_index_hardening` is live as version `20260929212153`; merged migration blob SHA is `2f802768edd9faa92efbd5157cdf225ffc1887f9`.
- All 7 AUTO-RUNTIME FK covering indexes are valid and ready in Production. Performance advisor `unindexed_foreign_keys` returned from 21 to the pre-runtime baseline 14, with **zero runtime-specific FK findings**. Security advisor baseline remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15 plus leaked-password-protection WARN 1; performance baseline is auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6. Newly created runtime indexes may appear as unused-index INFO until real runtime traffic exists.
- Production safety remains fail-safe: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.
- **Not claimed here:** the visual automation builder or automation notification surfaces. Those remain separate Work Packages.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-BUILDER`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs plus the existing workflow editor UI, draft/publish/version RPCs, Trigger Catalog, typed Condition Engine, Tool/Action Registry, approval model and runtime contracts. Build the visual/business-facing builder over those canonical authorities only; do not create a second workflow definition model, trigger/condition/action catalog, executor, queue, scheduler or approval engine.

## AUTO-APPROVAL Production closeout — 2026-09-29

- Work Package: `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-APPROVAL`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the internally controlled approval-orchestration RC scope.
- PR #353 merged to canonical `main@e04c57d45d53f64fbed4834dc273941a7001dd41`; final implementation head was `5542734d330f1ac456e78c1fa47d0094aca5912c`.
- Exact-head CI `36617523783` succeeded across lint, typecheck, 1395 tests, the complete PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification. Controlled SQL acceptance covered replay-safe approve/reject, required denial reason, direct-mutation fail-closed guard, delegation and delegated-reviewer decision, escalation, expiry and side-effect cleanliness.
- Exact-main CI `36618071238` succeeded on the merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36618411998` succeeded on the same SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deploy/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0152_automation_approval` is live as version `20260929192120`; merged migration blob SHA is `627d315fe761dacd751b4db346bd9fb6480177de`.
- Canonical approval policy authority remains `public.approval_rules`; the existing `public.conversation_messages` approval states remain the queue and `public.audit_logs.correlation_id` is reused as replay evidence. No second approval engine/request table/queue/outbox/action gateway/provider-send authority was created.
- All 6 real Smart Visions approval rules are now explicit `STRICT` policies with 24-hour expiry, 4-hour escalation, OWNER reviewers and governed delegation eligibility to OWNER/ADMIN/SALES_MANAGER. This changed policy metadata only; it did not create new Organization members.
- The 9 pre-existing real pending approvals were preserved and policy-snapshotted. Their legacy deadline clocks started at migration time instead of being retro-expired: 9 pending, 9 snapshotted, 0 expired-now and 0 escalation-due at verification.
- Pending approval state is guarded against direct mutation. A controlled Production attempt to bypass the governed command path failed closed and left queue cardinality unchanged.
- `decide_message_approval`, `delegate_message_approval`, `reconcile_due_message_approvals`, replay/actor/reviewer helpers are SECURITY INVOKER. Trusted mutation/reconciliation execution is service-role only; authenticated and anon cannot execute these RPCs. Trigger functions are not directly executable by service/authenticated/anon.
- Real Smart Visions OWNER read-only runtime verification returned `owner_can_review=true` for an existing pending approval. Deadline reconciliation returned `expired_count=0`, `escalated_count=0`; no Production approval decision or delegation was created.
- Approve/reject server actions now use governed RPCs rather than direct `conversation_messages` updates. Reject requires a bounded denial reason. The existing approval surface exposes mode, request/escalation/expiry timing and governed delegation while controlled WhatsApp provider-send pilots remain OWNER-only.
- `SEND_FOLLOWUP` remains `DEPENDENCY_PENDING`, approval-required and bound to `OUTBOUND_SEND`, but its remaining Work Package dependency is now only `AUTO-RUNTIME`; approval orchestration is no longer the blocker.
- Production side-effect evidence remained unchanged by verification: Automation Rules 0, published Automation versions 0, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108 and Follow-up Jobs 6. The approval queue remained 9 pending / 0 decided / 0 escalated. No synthetic customer/workflow/provider evidence and no provider call was created.
- Production safety remains fail-safe: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF. Unreleased/held channel AI pauses remain ON for Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Web Chat, Telegram, TikTok, SMS and RCS.
- Post-0152 advisor baseline shows no AUTO-APPROVAL-specific security or unindexed-FK regression: RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15, leaked-password-protection WARN 1, unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6. The new approval reviewer index is only an unused-index informational finding immediately after creation.
- **Not claimed here:** durable workflow execution, scheduler/outbox processing, retries, DLQ, compensation, timeout/concurrency runtime, visual builder or automation notifications. These remain separate Work Packages.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-RUNTIME`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs and the existing queue/outbox/event/follow-up execution primitives, workflow publication/enablement model, Tool/Action Registry, approval boundary, provider send authorities and all current automation execution consumers. Reuse existing primitives; do not create a second workflow engine, queue, outbox, scheduler, action gateway, provider-send authority or approval engine.

## Current verified continuation cursor — 2026-09-30

`SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-BUILDER`

This supersedes historical cursor text below. Fresh runtime/current-main verification is still required before mutation.

## Owner phase-map preservation lock

The owner reconfirmed on 2026-09-27 that the full historical Phase 0–12 map remains in scope together with the stable Work Packages and `PRODUCT_COMPLETENESS_AND_CONNECTION_ACCEPTANCE.md`. Historical percentages and PR counts are not completion metrics. A provider/API credential that has not arrived may block activation evidence, but does not remove the corresponding internal implementation requirement.

## Current execution and completeness authority

This file preserves historical Phase 0–12 dependencies. Read [NEXT_CHAT_HANDOFF.md](NEXT_CHAT_HANDOFF.md) for the latest cursor and [PRODUCT_COMPLETENESS_AND_CONNECTION_ACCEPTANCE.md](PRODUCT_COMPLETENESS_AND_CONNECTION_ACCEPTANCE.md) for owner-requested product detail, official customer onboarding, verified integration gaps and acceptance criteria. Historical phase counts/percentages do not measure current completion.


This is not a feature wishlist. It is the dependency history required to avoid rebuilding the same primitive twice.

For future execution, **do not assign or infer projected GitHub PR numbers**. The stable program roadmap is `MASTER_PROGRAM_SECTIONS.md`, which uses semantic Section and Work Package IDs. Historical PR numbers in this file remain implementation evidence only.

Current planned continuation cursor: `SECTION IDENTITY_CRM / CRM-SUPPORT-CASE`. PR #316 / Production migration `0131_crm_activity_task_v2` Production-verified the current Task/Activity scope on canonical `crm_tasks` with reminders, due/overdue state, Deal linkage and immutable audit-derived activity, while Production remained at 0 Tasks. `CRM-CUSTOM-OBJECTS` is deferred until a real typed-object use case exists. Support Case is the first verified missing CRM authority; build one canonical Case + Smart Core SLA path and do not fabricate Order/Payment links before those modules exist.

## Phase 0 — Architecture contracts

Status: **MERGED** in PR #172. No Production schema change was part of Phase 0.

Deliver before production code expansion:

- domain ownership map;
- source-of-truth map;
- critical state machines;
- event catalog and versioning convention;
- service contract template;
- policy/action boundary;
- usage/billing taxonomy;
- Growth OS reuse matrix.

No production schema changes in this phase.

## Phase 1 — SaaS Control Plane foundation

Status: **MERGED AND PROMOTED TO PRODUCTION** in PR #173 / migration 0068, with post-promotion FK-index cleanup 0069 also live. Production verification passed for schema, RLS, grants, runtime safety, usage classification, audit foundations, and advisor FK coverage. See `CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION.md` for the evidence-backed Gap Map and contract.

Extend the existing organization model toward:

Organization -> Brand -> Business -> Branch -> Department -> Team -> User.

Add/normalize:

- tenant/business scoping contract;
- role and permission model;
- entitlement model;
- subscription/pricing-version model;
- immutable usage classes;
- audit correlation IDs;
- configuration inheritance rules.

Keep current production behavior backward compatible.

## Phase 2 — Omnichannel domain boundary

Status: **COMPLETED AND MERGED**. Semantic adapter/status work merged in PR #175 at `main@5d812eee8a0e15dac658247b254660ae8f09aacd`; provider-identity/reconciliation work merged in PR #176 at `main@a5396156afc58a22cdf78baf7a495fb07ec38b40`. Production verification after PR #176 showed a healthy heartbeat, Shadow Mode ON, acquisition/dispatch SKIPPED, and zero Email/WhatsApp outbound messages after the merge. No Production schema migration was required.

Do not replace canonical provider journals/send gate.

Add a stable Channel Adapter contract:

- inbound normalization;
- outbound capability matrix;
- reply-window/policy metadata;
- native-app coexistence signals where available;
- reconciliation hooks;
- delivery/read status mapping;
- provider identity mapping.

Use the existing WhatsApp/Email paths as first adapters.

## Phase 3 — Customer 360 + CRM normalization

**Current Production checkpoint — 2026-09-28:** the earlier Slice 1–6 history below remains valid but is no longer the execution cursor. PR #309/#310 Production-verified canonical Person/Contact, PR #311 Production-verified governed Identity Graph resolution, PR #313 Production-verified explicit Person context for current Customer 360 authorities, and PR #314 Production-verified Account v2 over canonical `public.businesses`. Exact-main CI `36370424412` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36370581976` succeeded on `main@88a6ab7f1b4f4241ea031deda85b5cecd66b7bc1`; Production Worker is `dc6142da-42d9-42f4-9bf0-6d38be7bf358`. Production still has 0 real People and all 19 Businesses remain `UNCLASSIFIED` with no fabricated owner/hierarchy. The next bounded step is a fresh audit of the remaining Identity/CRM Work Packages rather than rebuilding already verified foundations.

Status: **ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION**. Slice 1 CRM Identity Foundation is Production-verified in PR #178 / migration 0070. Slice 2 Customer 360 Timeline is Production-verified in PR #179 / migration 0071. Slice 3 CRM Task Foundation is Production-verified in PR #181 / migration 0072 with FK-index cleanup 0073. Slice 4 Deal/Pipeline Foundation is Production-verified in PR #184 / migration 0074. Slice 5 Custom Field Governance is Production-verified in PR #188 / migration 0075. Slice 6 governed Dynamic Lead Segments is Production-verified in PR #191 / migration 0076. Existing Growth/Intent Opportunities remain acquisition evidence and are not repurposed as CRM Deals. Slice 6 remains LEAD-only + DYNAMIC-only and does not authorize Snapshot membership or Campaign/Workflow/provider execution. Implementation-runtime Worker checkpoint after PR #191 (before docs-only closeout) is `b6ad6482-11e1-4658-97e8-7f5d1a842318` with `failed=0`, acquisition/evidence/auto-dispatch SKIPPED and zero Email/WhatsApp outbound delta from promotion verification.

Extend the existing Lead/Business/Conversation CRM instead of creating a second CRM.

Add:

- contact identities;
- identity resolution;
- companies/accounts;
- custom fields/objects;
- activities/tasks;
- pipelines/deals;
- segments;
- customer timeline;
- merge/conflict rules.

## Phase 4 — Business Twin + Industry Packs

Add a versioned business configuration model for:

- branches;
- services/products;
- hours;
- staff;
- policies;
- booking/payment/delivery rules;
- tone/languages;
- permissions.

Industry Packs configure schemas, onboarding, default pipelines, workflows, metrics and evaluation scenarios without forking the core.

## Phase 5 — AI control plane

Extend existing multi-agent, prompt versions, knowledge versions, Context Hydrator and Cost Guard.

Introduce explicit:

- Context Compiler;
- Prompt Registry contract;
- Agent/Tool registry;
- Policy Engine;
- Action Gateway;
- confidence/uncertainty policy;
- outcome verification;
- evaluation datasets;
- shadow/canary version promotion.

## Phase 6 — Memory v2

Evolve current conversation memory into typed memory:

- Business Truth;
- Customer;
- Conversation;
- Working;
- Episodic;
- Operational;
- Agent Learning;
- Organizational.

Every memory record carries source, confidence, freshness, sensitivity, validity window, scope and permission.

No raw conversation sentence becomes Business Truth without validation policy.

## Phase 7 — Workflow and operational modules

Build through common state-machine/action contracts:

- booking;
- quote;
- payment;
- order;
- ticket/case;
- field service;
- loyalty;
- notification.

Workflow execution must be durable, idempotent and compensation-aware.

## Phase 8 — Billing and commercial platform

Add customer-facing commercial metering:

- platform subscription;
- setup fees;
- per-channel fees;
- AI billable raw cost × configured multiplier (initial commercial policy: 4x);
- voice;
- Hunter credits;
- seats;
- add-ons;
- API/storage/integrations;
- tax and multi-currency.

System retry/internal/cached/promotional usage must remain separable from billable usage.

## Phase 9 — Analytics / BI / Sheets

Reuse canonical operational evidence and create a dedicated analytics path.

Implement:

- Metrics Registry;
- event/CDC feed;
- analytics warehouse boundary;
- custom reports;
- Ask Your Data over governed metrics;
- CSV/XLSX/PDF/JSON export;
- Google Sheets scheduled/live sync;
- role/branch-aware reporting.

## Phase 10 — Hunter as paid customer module

Extend existing Hunter rather than cloning it.

Add tenant-facing:

- provider gateway;
- customer-configurable targeting;
- enrichment/verification credits;
- AI qualification;
- CRM import;
- intent/audit signals;
- ROI attribution;
- compliance boundary before outreach.

## Phase 11 — Enterprise + ecosystem

- SAML/OIDC/SCIM;
- data residency/cells;
- custom contracts and enterprise billing;
- sandbox;
- migration framework;
- marketplace;
- partner/reseller portal;
- developer SDKs/webhook console.

## Phase 12 — Mobile and customer-facing surfaces

One role-aware mobile app for owner/admin/staff/super-admin functions.

Customer portal for appointments, orders, quotes, invoices, payments, subscriptions, documents and tickets.

## Definition of Done for every phase

Applicable UI + API + persistence + permissions + audit + events + metrics + billing implications + retries/failure states + tests + observability + documentation + migration/rollback must be complete.

A decorative UI is not a completed feature.


### Phase 3 Slice 5 — Custom Field Governance

Status: **PRODUCTION-VERIFIED**.

- Gap audit merged in PR #187.
- Implementation merged in PR #188 at `main@b771883b1ba2f4787c6a466aea49f95a9052bd5f`.
- Production migration `0075_crm_custom_field_governance` version `20260923012557`.
- First slice supports governed Lead + Deal custom fields only.
- No Custom Objects, Segments or Person Contact were introduced.
- Production has 0 definitions / 0 options / 0 values after migration and rollback-only verification.
- Cloudflare runtime is proven by Worker `d42bd9c5-e862-4af6-ae70-787cbf81c5d6` with `failed=0`, acquisition/dispatch SKIPPED and zero Email/WhatsApp outbound rows after merge.
- Next dependency: Segment Governance gap audit. Do not build Segments on arbitrary JSON or ungoverned fields.


### Phase 3 Slice 6 — Governed Dynamic Lead Segments

- Gap audit: PR #190.
- Implementation: PR #191 at `main@a34bfd243d2f95e2ccad9895d5a753ef902a4299`.
- Production migration: `0076_crm_segment_governance` version `20260923093619`.
- Scope is LEAD-only, DYNAMIC-only, organization-wide Segment definitions with immutable semantic versions.
- Predicate AST is typed/allowlisted and enforced at API + database boundaries.
- Governed Custom Field predicates are restricted to compatible ACTIVE/filterable INTERNAL Lead definitions.
- Evaluation is authenticated, on-demand, deterministic and bounded; no persistent current-membership table exists.
- Segment evaluation is audience truth only and never invokes Campaign, Workflow or provider actions.
- Rollback-only Production verification left zero Segment data and zero audit fixture residue.
- Do not infer that Custom Objects are automatically the next implementation. Re-audit the remaining Phase 3 gap against Production evidence first.


## Future execution numbering policy

- Phases above remain useful dependency/history groupings.
- Future completion is tracked by stable Sections/Work Package IDs from `MASTER_PROGRAM_SECTIONS.md`.
- Extra audit, hardening, migration-fix, index-cleanup, hotfix or closeout PRs do not renumber later work.
- Actual PR numbers are recorded only after they exist.
- Chatwoot Community source integration is owned by `SECTION COMMUNICATION`; it is not represented as a guessed future PR number.


## 2026-09-28 Sales Pipeline V2 Production checkpoint

Within the Phase 3 CRM foundation and the stable `SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING / SALES-PIPELINE-V2` Work Package, PR #329 and Production migration `0139_sales_pipeline_v2` upgraded the existing canonical Deal/Pipeline authority rather than creating a replacement. Stage probability/forecast policies, canonical Team assignment, governed Deal probability override, bounded Won/Lost close evidence and derived forecasting read models are Production-verified.

Exact-main CI `36429525004` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36429837860` succeeded on `main@6d609ebf4abcd2faadd8f474ec1a48849acdb434`; Production migration version is `20260928135144`. Production remains 0 Pipelines / 0 Stages / 0 Deals, deliberately without synthetic acceptance data.

The execution cursor advances to `SALES-NEXT-ACTION`; Phase numbering does not change.


## 2026-09-28 Sales Next Action Production checkpoint

PR #331 and Production migration `0140_sales_next_action` delivered the bounded next-action queue by extending canonical CRM Tasks and deriving candidates from existing Lead/Deal/Conversation truth. Production then exposed a real enum/text UNION mismatch that CI did not reproduce. PR #332 and `0141_sales_next_action_status_cast_fix` normalized all source-status branches without adding a second queue or mutating customer data.

Final PR #332 exact-head CI `36462166810`, exact-main CI `36462560234` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36462884290` all succeeded. Production migration versions are `20260928174748` for 0140 and `20260928180433` for 0141.

Production currently contains 19 Leads / 0 Deals / 0 CRM Tasks / 0 NEXT_ACTION Tasks / 6 PENDING legacy followup jobs. Authenticated runtime returns 17 real stale-Lead candidates; 2 recent NEW Leads are correctly excluded. Human acceptance is explicit and service-governed; AI suggestions are advisory only; no blind auto-send or synthetic Production fixture was introduced.

`SALES-NEXT-ACTION` is **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED**.

The execution cursor advances to `MARKETING-CAMPAIGNS`; Phase numbering does not change.

## 2026-09-28 Marketing Campaigns Production checkpoint

## MARKETING-CAMPAIGNS Production closeout — 2026-09-28

**Disposition: IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED.**

- PR #334 extended the existing canonical `public.campaigns` / outreach plane for governed MARKETING campaigns; no second Campaign, audience, Consent, send, provider or attribution authority was created.
- MARKETING campaigns bind to immutable CAMPAIGN-purpose LEAD Segment Snapshots, governed Message Templates/Variants, schedule/channel/frequency/budget caps, explicit approval lifecycle, actor provenance and A/B allocation evidence. Direct conversion evidence is append-only and explicitly does not claim attribution.
- Campaign control never invokes provider sends. Consent/suppression remains enforced at the canonical send gate, and START/RESUME remains bounded by Shadow Mode.
- Final PR #334 exact-head CI `36470405184` succeeded on `de27a43c9408f0dcf8d02be849c8495fa5b503c2`. PR #334 merged to `main@6cdb3a7a35f1d0f98d0dac63110800a7a5361cad`; exact-main CI `36470727765` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36471049566` succeeded.
- Production migration `0142_marketing_campaign_governance` is applied as version `20260928191814`.
- Post-migration advisor verification found three new unindexed composite FKs on `marketing_campaign_conversion_evidence`. PR #335 / migration `0143_marketing_campaign_fk_index_hardening` added only those covering indexes and extended the PostgreSQL 17 smoke.
- PR #335 exact-head CI `36471556035` succeeded on `c209fbc762e47e45bf444e8c634bdd0ea5eb615c`. PR #335 merged to `main@b9dc839dcc30fbfb398852fc18258196290ab75c`; exact-main CI `36471907606` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36472242677` succeeded.
- Production migration `0143_marketing_campaign_fk_index_hardening` is applied as version `20260928192755`. The three MARKETING conversion FK indexes are present and the advisor now reports zero unindexed-FK findings for that table.
- Production remains honest: 7 total campaigns, all 7 HUNTER and 0 MARKETING; 43 existing outreach messages; 0 Marketing conversion evidence. No synthetic Production Campaign, Snapshot, Template, Variant or conversion fixture was created.
- Conversion evidence RLS is enabled. Authenticated users can read but cannot insert it; trusted mutation RPCs are service-role-only with explicit human actor provenance. All five campaign RPCs are SECURITY INVOKER. The three governance/immutability triggers are enabled.
- Shadow Mode remains ON; Kill Switch and pause controls remain unchanged.
- Existing Hunter runtime/data was preserved.

**2026-09-29 MARKETING-CONSENT Production closeout**

- PR #337 delivered MARKETING-CONSENT governance. Exact-head CI `36476465786` succeeded on `145fe69c3d4617d399a76842e0e516bdf8999c89`; the PR merged to `main@2ad80936aaae62020face3b263fc5b98cb666790`.
- Exact-main CI `36476868405` and Cloudflare Production Deploy `36477188658` both succeeded on the same main SHA.
- Production migration `0144_marketing_consent_governance` is applied as version `20260928205708`.
- Canonical permission evidence reuses `public.lead_sources`; canonical suppression/DNC remains `public.suppression_list`. No second Consent, preference, provider-permission or suppression authority was created.
- Permission evidence is append-only behind `lead_sources_marketing_permission_guard`. `record_marketing_permission_event` is SECURITY INVOKER and service-role-only with explicit human/preference-center provenance. `get_marketing_permission` and `get_marketing_preferences` are SECURITY INVOKER and readable by authenticated/service-role callers under existing RLS.
- Production verification remains honest: 0 marketing permission events, 0 effective preferences, 1 existing suppression row and 43 existing outreach messages. Post-migration verification observed 0 new outbound rows in the preceding 10 minutes. No synthetic opt-in/opt-out evidence was created.
- The post-0144 advisor pass introduced no new Marketing security or unindexed-FK regression; existing platform advisor debt remains separate.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the governed internal permission path. Real customer opt-in/opt-out evidence remains data-driven and must never be fabricated.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> MARKETING-ATTRIBUTION`.

For `MARKETING-ATTRIBUTION`, first audit existing outreach/reply/conversation/Lead/Deal and future booking/order/payment evidence. Do not infer attribution from Segment membership, Campaign approval, or direct conversion evidence alone; do not fabricate click/view events or create a second revenue truth.

Phase numbering does not change; the execution cursor advances to `MARKETING-ATTRIBUTION`.

## MARKETING-ATTRIBUTION Production closeout — 2026-09-29

- Work Package: `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> MARKETING-ATTRIBUTION`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the current observational attribution scope.
- PR #339 delivered the bounded read-only model on existing canonical authorities only. No second attribution table, revenue truth, Campaign store, CRM store, send path or provider truth was created.
- Implementation merge: `main@9e8373bb37102b3763b92d19abda66ee3acf724a`.
- Exact-head CI: `36484937638` SUCCESS on `dcd9fbbf51f6857cacee787f546cf11d7d4001af`.
- Exact-main CI: `36485322314` SUCCESS.
- Cloudflare Production Deploy: `36485633187` SUCCESS, including release-candidate smoke, exact validated bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0145_marketing_attribution_observational` is live. Near-simultaneous idempotent application recorded two migration-history entries, versions `20260928212346` and `20260928212358`. Their stored statement hashes differ, but both contain the same hardened contract markers (Lead-first touch index, Deal-bounded limit, reply/conversion outcome-time bounds and LINEAR truncation protection). The canonical runtime matches merged `main`; the schema contains only the intended single function/index and no manual migration-history deletion was performed.
- Production runtime under the real Smart Visions authenticated OWNER/RLS context successfully executed `FIRST_TOUCH`, `LAST_TOUCH` and `LINEAR` with the bounded 30-day/200-Deal contract.
- Current honest Production evidence: 19 Leads, 0 Deals / 0 WON Deals, 7 total Campaigns / 0 MARKETING Campaigns, 43 Outreach messages, 12 Sales Conversations, 37 Conversation messages, 0 Reply events and 0 Marketing conversion-evidence rows; therefore all three attribution models correctly return 0 rows. No synthetic Campaign, Deal, message, click, view, payment or revenue fixture was created.
- `get_marketing_attribution` is SECURITY INVOKER; authenticated/service_role may execute, anon may not. No persisted `marketing_attribution*` table/view/materialized authority exists.
- Attribution requires real sent MARKETING outreach before a canonical WON Deal. Exact Conversation linkage requires the same provider message ID. FIRST_TOUCH/LAST_TOUCH/LINEAR are bounded observational credit models only; `causal_claim=false` and `revenue_claimed=false`.
- Deal amount remains sales evidence, not collected revenue. Booking/Order/Invoice/Payment attribution stays deferred until their canonical authorities exist.
- Post-apply advisors show no Attribution-specific security finding. The new partial index is currently reported only as unused, expected while Production has no MARKETING Campaign/WON Deal attribution workload.
- No outbound/provider send side effect was introduced; Shadow Mode and existing safety controls remain unchanged.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> HUNTER-CUSTOMER-MODULE`.

Before mutation, re-audit current main/open PRs/exact-head CI and Production Hunter/discovery/enrichment/credit/dedupe/CRM-promotion/compliance authorities. Extend the existing Hunter only; do not create a second prospect, discovery, enrichment, credit, CRM, consent/suppression or provider-send authority.

# Production evidence checkpoint — HUNTER-CUSTOMER-MODULE

## HUNTER-CUSTOMER-MODULE Production closeout — 2026-09-29

- Work Package: `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> HUNTER-CUSTOMER-MODULE`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the current customer-facing Hunter read/composition scope.
- PR #341 merged to canonical `main@b36b1dc4df72f61d6de84a4b70475377eb1903cc`.
- Final exact-head CI `36493943818` succeeded after the test-only legacy Business bootstrap was aligned with long-lived Production's canonical Hunter enrichment shape; no Product/Production authority was changed to satisfy CI.
- Exact-main CI `36494234082` succeeded on the merge SHA across lint, typecheck, Vitest, PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke, Next build, Vinext and scheduled verification.
- Cloudflare Production Deploy `36494486700` succeeded on the same merge SHA.
- Production migration `0146_hunter_customer_module_read_model` is live as version `20260928224839`; merged migration file blob SHA is `768522507c96b0011020f550bd5906407f68553f`.
- The module extends existing canonical Hunter/CRM/usage/entitlement/suppression authorities only. It created no second Prospect store, CRM, credit ledger, entitlement store, consent source, send gate or provider runtime.
- Production runtime was executed under the real Smart Visions authenticated OWNER/RLS context. Current real evidence: 7 Hunter Campaigns, 13 discovered prospects, 13 enriched Businesses, 13 CRM-promoted prospects, 12 qualified prospects, 1 suppressed prospect, 18 Hunter usage units this month, USD 0.18 Hunter provider cost this month, 0 observed WON Deals and Hunter entitlement status `UNCONFIGURED`.
- `get_hunter_customer_summary` and `get_hunter_customer_prospects` are SECURITY INVOKER. Authenticated/service_role execution is granted; anon execution is denied.
- Contactability remains evidence only: Production returned `permission_true_count=0`. Suppression is surfaced, while actual outreach remains governed by canonical consent/channel/send gates and Shadow Mode.
- ROI remains observational WON Deal evidence only and does not claim Hunter caused revenue.
- Production stayed honest across the migration/runtime verification: Leads 19 -> 19, Outreach messages 43 -> 43, Conversation messages 37 -> 37, Usage events 108 -> 108, Deals 0 -> 0, Discovery records 13 -> 13, Growth opportunities 14 -> 14. No synthetic Production prospect, Lead, Deal, send or usage fixture was created.
- Post-apply Supabase advisor categories/counts show no Hunter-specific regression: security baseline remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15 and leaked-password-protection WARN 1; performance baseline remains unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16, multiple permissive policies 6. Unused indexes decreased from 223 to 222 and are not a Hunter security regression.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> CUSTOMER-SUCCESS-LOYALTY`.

## CUSTOMER-SUCCESS-LOYALTY Production closeout — 2026-09-29

- Work Package: `SECTION SEGMENT_SALES_MARKETING -> CUSTOMER-SUCCESS-LOYALTY`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the current RC scope.
- PR #343 merged to canonical `main@2c4b4ef72c3fb13f27012f16078323b4a68d1b9f`; implementation head was `b9aea3f746eb6c5331482a2fa899219786b8e1c5`.
- Exact-head CI `36497500213` succeeded across lint, typecheck, Vitest, PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke, Next build, Vinext and scheduled verification.
- Exact-main CI `36497865655` succeeded on the merge SHA.
- Cloudflare Production Deploy `36498116462` succeeded on the same exact main SHA, including exact-green checkout, release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0147_customer_success_loyalty` is live as version `20260928232514`; merged migration blob SHA is `792bfe02b27ca2f7eba61480edb3cb8368450670`.
- Canonical Account lifecycle remains `public.businesses.account_lifecycle`; CRM Task remains `public.crm_tasks`; Support remains `public.crm_support_cases`; Marketing Campaign remains `public.campaigns`. No second customer, task, campaign, consent, scoring, billing or workflow authority was created.
- Health/churn are bounded explainable derived evidence, not a second persisted scoring engine. New persisted truth is limited to append-only non-cash loyalty events and governed referral evidence linked back to canonical Account/Person/Lead/Deal truth.
- Production runtime succeeded under the real Smart Visions authenticated OWNER/RLS context. Current honest state is 19 Businesses, 0 CUSTOMER accounts, 0 FORMER_CUSTOMER accounts, 19 Leads, 0 Deals, 0 Tasks, 0 CUSTOMER_SUCCESS Tasks, 0 loyalty events, 0 referrals, 7 Campaigns and 0 lifecycle-classified Campaigns; `get_customer_success_summary` and `get_customer_success_accounts` return valid zero-data results without fixtures.
- Production remained side-effect clean: Outreach messages stayed 43 and Conversation messages stayed 37. No synthetic customer, Task, referral, loyalty, campaign, send or commercial evidence was created.
- RLS is enabled on `customer_loyalty_events`, `customer_referrals`, `crm_tasks` and `campaigns`. The loyalty immutable guard and Customer Success Task provenance guard are live.
- Customer-success read RPCs are SECURITY INVOKER and authenticated/service-role readable; trusted task/loyalty/referral/campaign mutations are SECURITY INVOKER, service-role-only, authenticated execution denied and anon execution denied.
- The trusted runtime keeps least privilege on `crm_tasks`: service_role still has no table-wide SELECT; only the required `due_at` and `metadata` read columns were added to the previously scoped grant set.
- Post-0147 advisors show no Customer Success security or unindexed-FK regression: security remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15 plus leaked-password-protection WARN 1; performance remains unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6. Fresh zero-row indexes are naturally reported unused and are not an integrity regression.
- Production safety is unchanged: Shadow Mode ON, global Kill Switch OFF, Email pause OFF, WhatsApp AI pause OFF and Agents pause OFF.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-WORKFLOW-MODEL`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs and the existing `automation_rules` / `approval_rules` authority. Production currently has 0 Smart Visions automation rules and 6 canonical approval rules. Extend `automation_rules` rather than creating a second workflow/automation authority; add immutable published-version semantics only where the existing model cannot represent them.

## AUTO-WORKFLOW-MODEL Production closeout — 2026-09-29

- Work Package: `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-WORKFLOW-MODEL`.
- Disposition: **IMPLEMENTED + CONTROLLED_TEST_VERIFIED + PRODUCTION_VERIFIED** for the governed workflow-definition model RC scope.
- PR #345 merged to canonical `main@c6abc26fd5521774ab2f0b4c70c3cffa482c0efe`; implementation head was `b65d0b501b876a5ad32e10a7808f6358f3c6814a`.
- Exact-head CI `36506580079` succeeded across lint, typecheck, tests, PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification.
- Exact-main CI `36506777208` succeeded on the merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36506935424` succeeded on that exact SHA, including release-candidate deploy/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0148_automation_workflow_model` is live as version `20260929011256`; merged migration blob SHA is `fc4f19680e6583b4273f4eeaa6ddae2028103a78`.
- Canonical workflow authority remains `public.automation_rules`. The new `public.automation_rule_versions` table is only the immutable published-version snapshot child of that authority; it is not a second automation engine, runtime, queue or outbox.
- The model now governs Trigger, ordered Conditions/Actions payloads, eligible owner, DRAFT/PUBLISHED state, optimistic draft revision, immutable published versions, explicit enable/disable and `NOT_READY / READY / DISABLED` execution eligibility. A newer draft can coexist with the last published READY version without silently changing runtime truth.
- Creation/update/publish/enable mutations are service-role-only SECURITY INVOKER RPCs with explicit human actor provenance. Authenticated browser access to both workflow tables is read-only under RLS; direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE is denied.
- Existing Web and Telegram Owner surfaces reuse the same canonical authority. Legacy `automation.create/update` parity now routes through the governed RPC boundary; richer draft/publish/enable controls remain specialized workflow-model actions.
- Production remains honest: 0 automation rules, 0 published automation versions and 6 existing approval rules. Outreach messages stayed 43 and conversation messages stayed 37. No synthetic Production workflow, execution, provider send, Task, Lead or approval evidence was created.
- Production safety is unchanged: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.
- Post-0148 advisors show no Automation-specific security or unindexed-FK regression. Existing platform baseline remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15, leaked-password-protection WARN 1, unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6. Fresh zero-row workflow indexes are naturally reported unused.
- **Not claimed here:** trigger catalog semantics, condition evaluation, tool/action registry, approval orchestration, durable execution, retries/compensation, builder or notifications. Those remain their separate Work Packages, especially `AUTO-RUNTIME`.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-TRIGGER-CATALOG`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs and existing event/trigger/state catalogs plus all code paths that consume `automation_rules.trigger_key`. Extend the canonical workflow model only; do not create a second event bus, trigger store, workflow engine, queue or outbox.

- Production migration `0149_automation_trigger_catalog` is live as version `20260929064517`; merged migration blob SHA is `8bc156375b355e8da80060de5ac4fa907d6f34d7`.
- The canonical workflow authority remains `public.automation_rules`. `public.automation_trigger_catalog` is system-owned reference metadata only; it stores no trigger occurrences and creates no event bus, queue, outbox, executor or second workflow authority.
- Production contains 32 cataloged trigger contracts across all 15 required families: 17 `AVAILABLE`, 15 `DEPENDENCY_PENDING`, 0 `DEPRECATED`. Booking, Quote, Order, Invoice and Payment trigger contracts remain dependency-gated until their canonical owning modules exist.
- Draft/root definitions fail closed on unknown trigger keys. Immutable published versions accept only `AVAILABLE` triggers, and enablement re-checks the latest published trigger contract. The three guards are live and SECURITY INVOKER.
- Trigger Catalog RLS is enabled. Authenticated and service-role runtime access is SELECT-only; authenticated INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are denied. A real Smart Visions OWNER/RLS read saw all 32 catalog entries and the dependency-pending Booking contract.
- Production remained side-effect clean: Automation Rules 0, published Automation versions 0, Approval Rules 6, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108 and Follow-up Jobs 6. No synthetic workflow/event/customer/provider evidence was created.
- Production safety is unchanged: Shadow Mode ON; Global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.

- Exact-head CI `36571352718` succeeded across lint, typecheck, tests, the full PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification. An earlier head run exposed only a compact-CI-bootstrap drift for the legacy Lead `recommended_offer` column; the bootstrap was aligned to the real Production lineage and the complete chain then passed.
- Exact-main CI `36571715430` succeeded on the merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36572032475` succeeded on that exact SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0150_automation_condition_engine` is live as version `20260929130243`; merged migration blob SHA is `fc0b663d890f14fe0fa89c3737b3af919fb80827`.
- Canonical workflow-condition truth remains `public.automation_rules.conditions`. `public.automation_condition_fact_catalog` is system-owned metadata only and stores no customer/runtime fact values; no second workflow/rules engine, fact store, queue or outbox was created.
- The condition contract is typed and bounded: `GROUP(AND/OR)` + `PREDICATE`, TEXT/NUMBER/BOOLEAN/UUID/TIMESTAMP facts, depth <= 4, <= 20 leaves, <= 8 children/top-level nodes and <= 20 list values. A condition set targets one canonical subject type and must match the trigger family when subject-bound conditions are used.
- Production catalog contains 61 allowlisted facts across 7 canonical subject types: Lead, Deal, CRM Task, Account, Conversation, Segment Snapshot and Support Case. Evaluation uses fixed Organization-scoped reads from those existing authorities; there is no dynamic SQL or expression-eval surface.
- Condition validation/fact loading/evaluation RPCs are SECURITY INVOKER, service-role executable only; authenticated and anon execution is denied. Authenticated users can read the fact metadata catalog but cannot INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE it.
- A read-only Production runtime evaluation against an existing Smart Visions Lead deterministically matched 2/2 bounded numeric Lead conditions. No Production fixture or customer/provider event was created.
- The existing least-privilege Task boundary was preserved: `service_role` still has no table-wide SELECT on `crm_tasks`; only already-governed columns such as status/due/assignee remain readable, while priority/task_type remain denied.
- Production stayed side-effect clean: Automation Rules 0, published Automation versions 0, Approval Rules 6, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108 and Follow-up Jobs 6.
- Post-0150 advisors show no Condition Engine-specific security or unindexed-FK regression. Existing baseline remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15, leaked-password-protection WARN 1, unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6.
- Production safety is unchanged: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.

- PR #351 merged to canonical `main@3a8cbe0735cb948556c9154cde5a2c6e51887ef9`; final implementation head was `e723d18d8d38e5093f7784506cd67b0139e610c4`.
- Exact-head CI `36610866049` succeeded across lint, typecheck, tests, the complete PostgreSQL 17 migration/smoke chain, Next build, Vinext and Cloudflare scheduled verification. Earlier head CI `36610457171` exposed only a compact-CI lineage gap: the legacy Production `approval_rules` authority was absent from the test bootstrap. The bootstrap was aligned to the real Production schema and the full chain then passed without weakening the product contract.
- Exact-main CI `36611263495` succeeded on the merge SHA. Cloudflare Production Deploy `36611505849` succeeded on that same SHA through credential preflight, isolated release-candidate deployment/smoke, controlled SSR load, exact-bundle promotion, routed Production smoke and safe API/webhook rejection smoke.
- Production migration `0151_automation_tool_action_registry` is live as version `20260929182352`; merged migration blob SHA is `8451fc77a17ac2d998b2fdf23716800c527627cc`.
- Canonical workflow action-definition truth remains `public.automation_rules.actions`. `public.tool_action_registry` is system-owned contract metadata only; it stores no action requests and creates no second executor, action gateway, queue, outbox, provider-send authority or approval engine.
- Production contains exactly 6 current workflow action contracts. `GENERATE_PREVIEW` and `HANDOFF_HUMAN` are `AVAILABLE`; `CREATE_OPERATOR_BRIEF`, `MARK_HOT`, `PAUSE_AUTOMATION` and `SEND_FOLLOWUP` are explicitly `DEPENDENCY_PENDING`.
- Every registered action carries typed input/output schemas, permission key, scope, idempotency contract, cost class, side-effect class, approval requirement, verifier and audit contract.
- `SEND_FOLLOWUP` is bound to the existing `APPROVED_SEND_POLICY` / `OUTBOUND_SEND` authority, classified `PROVIDER_METERED` + `EXTERNAL_PROVIDER`, requires approval, and remains dependency-gated on `AUTO-APPROVAL` + `AUTO-RUNTIME`. The real Smart Visions `OUTBOUND_SEND` approval rule exists in Production with `requires_approval=true`.
- `MARK_HOT` is bound to `SALES_SCORING_GOVERNANCE`; Registry metadata explicitly forbids a direct `leads.status` write that would bypass canonical Sales Scoring evidence.
- Unknown action keys fail closed at Draft. Dependency-pending actions may be designed in Draft but fail closed at Publish. Enablement re-checks the latest immutable published action snapshot so a later deprecation cannot silently reactivate a workflow.
- Tool/Action Registry RLS is enabled. A real Smart Visions OWNER authenticated read saw all 6 contracts. Authenticated users and service role have SELECT-only table access; authenticated/anon cannot execute the trusted validator, while service role can. Validator and guards are SECURITY INVOKER.
- Three live guards protect the workflow root, immutable published versions and enablement boundary.
- Read-only Production validation proved `GENERATE_PREVIEW` publish validation succeeds, `SEND_FOLLOWUP` is valid as a Draft contract, and its Publish validation remains blocked while dependency-pending.
- Automation UI now reads action contracts from the database Registry instead of a hardcoded action list and surfaces action availability beside each workflow.
- Production remained side-effect clean: Automation Rules 0, published Automation versions 0, Approval Rules 6, Outreach Messages 43, Conversation Messages 37, Usage Events 108 and Follow-up Jobs 6. No synthetic workflow/customer/provider evidence was created.
- Post-0151 advisors show no Tool/Action Registry-specific security or unindexed-FK regression. Existing baseline remains RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO 15, leaked-password-protection WARN 1, unindexed FKs 14, auth RLS initPlan 16 and multiple permissive policies 6.
- Production safety is unchanged: Shadow Mode ON; global Kill Switch OFF; Email pause OFF; WhatsApp AI pause OFF; Agents pause OFF.
- **Not claimed here:** approval orchestration, durable workflow/action execution, retries/compensation runtime, visual builder or notifications. Those remain separate Automation Work Packages.

**Fresh continuation cursor:** `SECTION AUTOMATION -> AUTO-APPROVAL`.

Before mutation, fresh-audit current main/open PRs plus the existing `approval_rules` authority, Shadow approval queue, approved-send policy, message approval surfaces and all approval consumers. Extend the existing approval boundary only; do not create a second approval engine, action gateway, workflow runtime, queue, outbox or provider-send authority.
